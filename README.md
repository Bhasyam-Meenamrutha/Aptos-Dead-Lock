# DeadLock

DeadLock is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to act as a **digital will** and **life activity monitor** on the blockchain.  
It ensures that your assets are securely distributed according to your wishes if you become inactive for a specified period.

---

## 🚀 Concept

When a user registers on DeadLock, they:
1. Specify **how often** they will open or interact with the dApp (e.g., every 30 days).
2. Provide **beneficiary details** – wallet addresses of family members or others along with the percentage of funds each should receive.
3. Deposit funds into the contract.

If the user fails to check in within the specified time:
- The contract automatically assumes the user is inactive (or deceased).
- Funds are released to the beneficiaries in the **exact percentages** set during registration.
